The original project is no longer actively developed or maintained.

Trying to port it to an updated Unity, SteamVR and Oculus Engines and get it to run on an Oculus Quest.

# SoundStage VR

SoundStage VR is a virtual reality music sandbox built specifically for room-scale VR. Whether youâ€™re a professional DJ creating a new sound, or a hobbyist who wants to rock out on virtual drums, SoundStage gives you a diverse toolset to express yourself.

This is not an officially supported Google product.

## Requirements
* An SteamVR or Oculus running on a PC or Oculus Quest
* Unity 2019.2.13.f1 if you'd like to modify the project

## Setup
The Unity project can run without any additional components - just open the main scene to get started. 

That being said, the project is missing two third-party components available in the Unity Asset Store:

* [SE Natural Bloom & Dirty Lens] (https://github.com/sonicether/SE-Natural-Bloom-Dirty-Lens) creates the glow and bloom effects seen in the released software, no longer available on Unity (http://u3d.as/7v5)
* [Runtime AudioClip Loader](http://u3d.as/hEP) enables MP3 sample loading and improves the performance of all sample loading

To use each of these assets, add the full asset package to the *third_party* folder. If they are not automatically replaced, remove the corresponding placeholder scripts in that same folder.

A full build of the project with the third-party components is included in the *bin* folder.
